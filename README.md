## How to use ?
- Create a file named /db.js

const mariadb = require('mariadb');

const pool = mariadb.createPool({
	host: 'localhost',
	user: 'root',
	password: 'password',
	database: 'db_name',
	connectionLimit: 5,
	port: '3306',
});

module.exports = pool;

```
- Create a file named /config.json
```json
{
	"token": "discord_token_here",
	"clientId": "discord_client_id_here",
	"guildId": "discord_server_id_here", // leave it empty to deploy commands in all the guilds
	"lang": "fr",
	"DEBUG_MODE": false,
	"INVITE_THRESHOLD": 10,
	"INVITER_ROLE_NAME": "ðŸ“€ãƒ»VIP", // don't need this if you already have a roleToGiveId (for single guild)
	"roleToGiveId": "role_id", // if you use the bot for aa single guild, put the role id here
	"DEBOUNCE_TIME": 300000 // Minimum time before updating member counts to prevent spam (5 minutes by default)
}
```
